Earlier this year, as part of my Technical Architect certification preparation [I wrote a blog article](http://limitexception.com/2013/01/24/object-access-by-salesforce-portal-license/) showing the various portal license types and the standard objects they allowed access to.

In Summer ’13 Salesforce introduced a new product called [Salesforce Communities](http://www.salesforce.com/chatter/features/communities/) that allows you to expose your Salesforce data to external parties and all in all offers a significant functionality improvement over Portals. Yaron Wilf explores some of the benefits in his blog post on the [Cloud Sherpa’s blog.](http://blog.cloudsherpas.com/cloud-strategy-2/salesforce-communities-your-solution-to-social-service-and-support/)

Portals are still available for purchase however so its useful to see both license types side by side and understand the subtle differences between the two.
