It is the culmination of at least 18 months engineering to put Salesforce on an API and mobile first footing for future development.

It is a responsive webapp which is also wrapped in a native iOS or Android container and shipped as ‘Salesforce1’ hybrid app.

It is an umbrella marketing term for the collection Salesforce.com owned platforms. It encompasses the traditional ‘force.com’ platform that Salesforce1 is built on and also the existing non-force.com API/Platforms underpinning Pardot, ExactTarget, Heroku and others.
