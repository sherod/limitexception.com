With [Force.com Canvas](http://wiki.developerforce.com/page/Force.com_Canvas) going Generally Available in Summer 13 (May-June 2013) I thought it was time to take a look. The presentation used [Canvas-PHP](http://blogs.developerforce.com/developer-relations/2013/02/using-php-for-canvas-applications.html) by [Josh Birk](https://twitter.com/joshbirk)

Here is the presentation I gave to the [Sydney Salesforce Developers User Group](http://www.meetup.com/Sydney-Salesforce-Platform-Developer-Users-Group/) on [17 April](http://www.meetup.com/Sydney-Salesforce-Platform-Developer-Users-Group/events/112802562/).
