Winter 12 hit the sandboxes this week and we were hit by one particular problem and I’ve seen two other issues pop up as well.

* [http://boards.developerforce.com/t5/Apex-Code-Development/Invalid-session/td-p/336951](http://boards.developerforce.com/t5/Apex-Code-Development/Invalid-session/td-p/336951)

* And an issue where related list hovers not showing on an apex:detail tag (You may be able to see the link here on Linked In —[http://www.linkedin.com/groupItem?view=&gid=142613&type=member&item=71785968&qid=3405f155-f30a-4006-bd53-0444a8c2c7a7&goback=%2Egna_142613](http://www.linkedin.com/groupItem?view=&gid=142613&type=member&item=71785968&qid=3405f155-f30a-4006-bd53-0444a8c2c7a7&goback=%2Egna_142613)

I haven’t confirmed the last two, but I’ve experienced the first. Have you felt anything from the Winter 12 release?
