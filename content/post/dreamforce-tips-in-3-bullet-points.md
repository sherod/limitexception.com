### Have specific goals for the event.

* What can you learn.

### Plan your must see events and organise your agenda around those events.

* There is SO MUCH on, going in without a game plan will mean you’ll miss everything.

### Comfortable shoes and some painkillers.

* You’ll do a lot of walking and standing :)
