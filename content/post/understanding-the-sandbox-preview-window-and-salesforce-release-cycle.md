Another month rolls around and its time for yet another Salesforce release Preview Window…. this time for Spring ‘14.

Understanding the release windows and how they work can take a little bit of effort to get your head around. You can find [Salesforce’s explanation here](http://blogs.salesforce.com/company/2013/11/spring-14-sandbox-preview-instructions.html), but what follows is my visual representation.

### The lead up to a release for both Sandboxes and Production Orgs

### How to decide what you should do

I haven’t listed the Sandboxes here, you should refer to the official [Salesforce blog](http://blogs.salesforce.com/company/2013/11/spring-14-sandbox-preview-instructions.html) for the list of Sandboxes which are targeted for Pre-Release updates.
