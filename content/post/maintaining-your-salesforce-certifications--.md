### How do I maintain my certification?

* Each track you hold a certification in requires you to undertake maintenance exam each release.

* The maintenance exam is a simple 15 minute (5–15 question) multiple choice exam booked via Web Assessor and undertaken without a proctor (i.e. at your desk, no supervision)

### The Schedule

Every 12 months you need to pay a renewal fee to unlock the next 12 months maintenance exams.

### Remember…

* If you fall more than two releases behind, you will lose all your Certification’s in that and have to re-sit them all!
* The fee is due 12 months after you passed your first exam for that track (i.e. Administrator or Developer)
