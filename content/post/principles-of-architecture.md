At Forcelandia 2017 I gave my perspective on Software Architecture, I gave the same presentation at Down Under Dreaming — Sydney 2017 and have recorded it in a YouTube video.

For those looking to watch it, you can find it here: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND-dX-__I1Y&t=7s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND-dX-__I1Y&t=7s)
