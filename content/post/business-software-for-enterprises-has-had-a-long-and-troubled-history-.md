Business software for Enterprises has had a long and troubled history.

Many an Enterprise has struggled with an out of control backend system into which money and years are poured until eventually, like some farmed out asteroid, it can only be discarded and replaced.

This outcome has left behind a lot of Trauma, and this trauma is shaping the next generation of software and its shaping Salesforce deployments all over the world.

And so we come to the issue, ‘Configuration’ vs ‘Customization’. Should one ‘Configure’ Salesforce, or ‘Customize’ Salesforce. What’s the right proportion? What even is ‘Customization’ of Salesforce.

Truth is its a word without a clear definition, we have ‘clicks not code’ as a mantra sprouted by Salesforce. The marketing material promises much capability out of the box — and yet there are apparently 4 million Salesforce Developers out there.

The only thing worse than too much customisation is too little. A product which fails to actually allow you to complete your business Activity is of no use to anyone, and slavishly clinging to slogans is a great way for cargo culting to take over.

I would like propose that ‘Customisation’ of Salesforce is when Standard functionality is replaced with code.

This specifically excludes custom built functionality specific to a net knew capability. Perhaps you need a particular kind of Order creation screen.

I’ve seen complex Salesforce installations built off the back of multiple App Exchange products
