After a lifetime of being picked last for sporting teams I’ve finally made ‘Most Valued Player’ status in something. :)

And I’m proud and excited for it to be what I’ve thrown myself into over the last couple of years (That’s Salesforce incase you didn’t realise).

I’m still going through all the bits and pieces Salesforce sent me and I’m completely flat out at home and work, but I really wanted to thank [Matt Lacey](http://twitter.com/laceysnr) for his support in achieving this.

Of course the other enormous thing that happened this week is I changed jobs. I’m now with [Cloud Sherpas](http://www.cloudsherpas.com/) here in Sydney and I’m really looking forward to making a difference.
