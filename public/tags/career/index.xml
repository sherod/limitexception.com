      <description>Ideally a job interview is an opportunity for you to demonstrate your knowledge and to convince your prospective employer you have the right attitude, the right knowledge and the right experience to fulfill their requirements.
One hopes that each new position should be some kind of advancement, either in salary or responsibility (or ideally both).
Naturally there is competition in this process from other candidates, this competition and your own internal doubt can and should drive you to prepare for an interview so you can present your best self when the time comes.</description>
